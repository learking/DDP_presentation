## The Context

* When a bank receives a loan application, based on the applicantâ€™s profile the bank has to make a decision regarding whether to go ahead with the loan approval or not. Based on history records, there are two types of customers:
    + Good applicant: pay on time and do not charge off
    + Bad applicant: do not pay on time and/or charge off
* The German Credit data set used comes from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/statlog/german/)
